Fleshing Out Ideas and First to do on the Agenda

Watch a live Recital

Sims will either set up an event to either
Perform Live
Watch Live Performance








If they are watching a performance live:

Performer must be a part of an association that will host them.
Performer must have a skill level that’s high on the instrument of choice.
Player travels to specific venue a pay entrance fee
Player gets to pick what kind of performance to watch
Venue (provided by mod) has an auditorium for performers where the stage (possibly) changes based on the instrument centered around the performance.
There is an area for sims to get up and socialize, as just a performance would be boring for the player and would give them no reason to use this except as a glorified music player.
Have Performer sims spawn on stage, must keep viewers off the stage. (Look into this.)
Piano sound *must* travel through the auditorium venue. Might need to do some fine tweaking to code to enable this.
Sims that aren’t apart of the household must prioritize the seating arrangements of the auditorium, not interacting with other sims.
Sims must remain quiet in the auditorium area, but not in other areas.
New venue type! Get to choose between formal or normal outfits only!
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star “Level Reflection” (unlocks at level 2), TTS changes based on skill.
